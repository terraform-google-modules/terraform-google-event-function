# terraform-google-event-function

This module configures a system which responds to filtered Stackdriver
Logging events by invoking a Cloud Functions function.

A project-level Stackdriver Logging export uses a provided filter to
identify events of interest and publish them to a dedicated Pub/Sub
topic. A Cloud Functions function subscribes to the topic and uses
provided source code to process each event. The source code is
retrieved from an archive which is created locally and stored in a
Storage bucket.

## Usage

The (examples) directory contains tested references of how to use this
module.

## Requirements

The following requirements must be met in order to invoke this module:

1. [Software dependencies](#software-dependencies).
2. [IAM roles](#iam-roles).
3. [APIs](#apis).

### Software Dependencies

The following software dependencies must be installed on the system
from which this module will be invoked:

- [Terraform][terraform-site] v0.11.x
- [Google Terraform provider][terraform-provider-google-site] v1.20.0

### IAM Roles

The Service Account which will be used to invoke this module must have
the following IAM roles:

- Cloud Functions Developer
- Compute Viewer
- Logs Configuration Writer
- Pub/Sub Admin
- Service Account User
- Storage Admin

### APIs

The project against which this module will be invoked must have the
following APIs enabled:

- Cloud Functions API
- Cloud Pub/Sub API
- Google Cloud Storage

The [Project Factory module][project-factory-module-site] can be used to
provision projects with specific APIs activated.

## Testing

The (test/fixtures) and (test/integration) directories comprise
Terraform modules and InSpec tests used to verify the behaviour of this
module.

### Testing Software Dependencies

The following software dependencies must be installed on the system
from which the tests will be invoked:

- [Ruby][ruby-site] v2.5
- [Bundler][bundler-site] v1.17

### Integration Tests

Integration tests are invoked using [Kitchen][kitchen-site],
[Kitchen-Terraform][kitchen-terraform-site], and [InSpec][inspec-site].

Kitchen instances are configured in (kitchen.yml). The instances use
the modules in (test/fixtures) to invoke identically named modules in
(examples) and test this module.

#### Integration Tests Configuration

Each Kitchen instance requires a variable file named `terraform.tfvars`
to be created and populated in the associated test fixture. For
convenience, a sample file is available at
(test/fixtures/shared/terraform.tfvars.sample).

A key file for a Service Account with the required
[IAM roles](#iam-roles) must be downloaded from the GCP console and
placed in the root directory of this repository. The key file must be
renamed to `credentials.json`.

#### Integration Tests Execution

Run `make test_integration_docker` to execute all of the Kitchen
instances in a non-interactive manner within a Docker container.

Alternatively, the Kitchen instances can be invoked interactively:

1. Run `make docker_run` to start the Docker container. The root
   directory of this repository will be mounted in the Docker container
   at `/cft/workdir/`.
1. Run `kitchen create` to initialize all Kitchen instances, or run
   `kitchen create <INSTANCE_NAME>` to initialize a specific Kitchen
   instance.
1. Run `kitchen converge` to apply all Kitchen instances, or run
   `kitchen converge <INSTANCE_NAME>` to apply a specific Kitchen
   instance.
1. Run `kitchen verify` to test all Kitchen instances, or run
   `kitchen verify <INSTANCE_NAME>` to test a specific Kitchen instance.
1. Run `kitchen destroy` to destroy all Kitchen instances, or run
   `kitchen destroy <INSTANCE_NAME>` to destroy a specific Kitchen
   instance.

## Linting

Linters are available for most of the filetypes in this repository.

### Linting Software Dependencies

The following software dependencies must be installed on the system
from which the linting will be invoked:

- [flake8][flake8-site].
- [ShellCheck][shellcheck-site].
- [terrafom validate][terraform-validate-site].

### Linting Execution

Run `make check --silent` to execute all of the linters.

Alternatively, the linters  can be invoked individually.

- Run `make check_python` to lint Python files.
- Run `make check_shell` to lint Shell files.
- Run `make check_terraform` to lint Terraform files.

## Documentation

The documentation of inputs and outputs for modules in this repository
is automatically generated in each module's `README.md` based on the
contents of the relevant `.tf` files.

### Documentation Software Dependencies

The following software dependencies must be installed on the system
from which the documentation will be generated:

- [terraform-docs][terraform-docs-site] v0.6.0

### Generation

Run `make generate_docs` to update the documentation.
