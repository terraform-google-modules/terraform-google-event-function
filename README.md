# Event Function

This module configures a system which responds to events by invoking a
Cloud Functions function.

The root module configures a function sourced from a directory on
localhost to respond to a given event trigger. The source directory is
compressed and uploaded as a Cloud Storage bucket object which will be
leveraged by the function.

Alternatively, the
[repository-function submodule][repository-function-submodule]
configures a function sourced from a Cloud Source Repositories
repository.

## Compatibility

This module is meant for use with Terraform 0.12. If you haven't [upgraded](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-12.html) and need a Terraform 0.11.x-compatible version of this module, the last released version intended for Terraform 0.11.x
is [0.1.0](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/event-function/google/0.1.0).


## Usage

The
[automatic-labelling-from-localhost example][automatic-labelling-from-localhost-example]
is a tested reference of how to use the root module with the
[event-project-log-entry submodule][event-project-log-entry-submodule].

## Terraform Created Source Files

If you have `local_file` Terraform resources that need to be included in the function's archive include them in the optional `source_dependent_files`.

This will tell the module to wait until those files exist before creating the archive.

Example can also be seen in `examples/dynamic-files`

```hcl
resource "local_file" "file" {
  content  = "some content"
  filename = "${path.module}/function_source/terraform_created_file.txt"
}

module "localhost_function" {
  ...

  source_dependent_files = [local_file.file]
}
```

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| available\_memory\_mb | The amount of memory in megabytes allotted for the function to use. | number | `"256"` | no |
| bucket\_force\_destroy | When deleting the GCS bucket containing the cloud function, delete all objects in the bucket first. | bool | `"false"` | no |
| bucket\_labels | A set of key/value label pairs to assign to the function source archive bucket. | map(string) | `<map>` | no |
| bucket\_name | The name to apply to the bucket. Will default to a string of the function name. | string | `""` | no |
| bucket\_prefix | The prefix of the bucket name for object subdirectory path. | string | `""` | no |
| create\_bucket | Whether to create a new bucket or use an existing one. If false, `bucket_name` should reference the name of the alternate bucket to use. | bool | `"true"` | no |
| description | The description of the function. | string | `"Processes events."` | no |
| entry\_point | The name of a method in the function source which will be invoked when the function is executed. | string | n/a | yes |

| event\_trigger | A source that fires events in response to a condition in another service. | map(string) | n/a | yes |
| event\_trigger\_failure\_policy\_retry | A toggle to determine if the function should be retried on failure. | bool | `"false"` | no |
| ingress\_settings | The ingress settings for the function. Allowed values are ALLOW_ALL, ALLOW_INTERNAL_AND_GCLB and ALLOW_INTERNAL_ONLY. Changes to this field will recreate the cloud function. | string | `"ALLOW_ALL"` | no |
| labels | A set of key/value label pairs to assign to the Cloud Function. | map(string) | `<map>` | no |
| max\_instances | The maximum number of parallel executions of the function. | number | `"0"` | no |
| name | The name to apply to any nameable resources. | string | n/a | yes |

| region | The region in which resources will be applied. | string | n/a | yes |
| runtime | The runtime in which the function will be executed. | string | n/a | yes |
| service\_account\_email | The service account to run the function as. | string | `""` | no |
| source\_dependent\_files | A list of any Terraform created `local_file`s that the module will wait for before creating the archive. | object | `<list>` | no |
| source\_directory | The pathname of the directory which contains the function source code. | string | n/a | yes |
| timeout\_s | The amount of time in seconds allotted for the execution of the function. | number | `"60"` | no |
| vpc\_connector | The VPC Network Connector that this cloud function can connect to. It should be set up as fully-qualified URI. The format of this field is projects/*/locations/*/connectors/*. | string | `"null"` | no |
| vpc\_connector\_egress\_settings | The egress settings for the connector, controlling what traffic is diverted through it. Allowed values are ALL_TRAFFIC and PRIVATE_RANGES_ONLY. If unset, this field preserves the previously set value. | string | `"null"` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
