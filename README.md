# Event Function

This module configures a system which responds to events by invoking a
Cloud Functions function.

The root module configures a function sourced from a directory on
localhost to respond to a given event trigger. The source directory is
compressed and uploaded as a Cloud Storage bucket object which will be
leveraged by the function.

Alternatively, the
[repository-function submodule][repository-function-submodule]
configures a function sourced from a Cloud Source Repositories
repository.

## Compatibility
This module is meant for use with Terraform 0.13+ and tested using Terraform 1.0+.
If you find incompatibilities using Terraform `>=0.13`, please open an issue.

If you haven't [upgraded][terraform-0.13-upgrade] and need a Terraform
0.12.x-compatible version of this module, the last released version
intended for Terraform 0.12.x is [v1.6.0](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/-event-function/google/v1.6.0).

## Usage

The
[automatic-labelling-from-localhost example][automatic-labelling-from-localhost-example]
is a tested reference of how to use the root module with the
[event-project-log-entry submodule][event-project-log-entry-submodule].

## Terraform Created Source Files

If you have `local_file` Terraform resources that need to be included in the function's archive include them in the optional `source_dependent_files`.

This will tell the module to wait until those files exist before creating the archive.

Example can also be seen in `examples/dynamic-files`

```hcl
resource "local_file" "file" {
  content  = "some content"
  filename = "${path.module}/function_source/terraform_created_file.txt"
}

module "localhost_function" {
  ...

  source_dependent_files = [local_file.file]
}
```

| bucket\_name | The name to apply to the bucket. Will default to a string of the function name. | `string` | `""` | no |
| create\_bucket | Whether to create a new bucket or use an existing one. If false, `bucket_name` should reference the name of the alternate bucket to use. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| description | The description of the function. | `string` | `"Processes events."` | no |
| entry\_point | The name of a method in the function source which will be invoked when the function is executed. | `string` | n/a | yes |
