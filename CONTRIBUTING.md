# Contributing

This document provides guidelines for contributing to the module.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies must be installed on the development system:

- [Docker Engine][docker-engine]
- [Google Cloud SDK][google-cloud-sdk]
- [make]

## Generating Documentation for Inputs and Outputs

The Inputs and Outputs tables in the READMEs of the root module,
submodules, and example modules are automatically generated based on
the `variables` and `outputs` of the respective modules. These tables
must be refreshed if the module interfaces are changed.

### Execution

Run `make generate_docs` to generate new Inputs and Outputs tables.

## Integration Testing

Integration tests are used to verify the behaviour of the root module,
submodules, and example modules. Additions, changes, and fixes should
be accompanied with tests.

The integration tests are run using Golang and
are packaged within a Docker image for convenience.

The general strategy for these tests is to verify the behaviour of the
[example modules](./examples/), thus ensuring that the root module,
submodules, and example modules are all functionally correct.

### Test Environment
The easiest way to test the module is in an isolated test project. The setup for such a project is defined in [test/setup](./test/setup/) directory.

To use this setup, you need a service account with Project Creator access on a folder. Export the Service Account credentials to your environment like so:

```
export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON=$(< credentials.json)
```

You will also need to set a few environment variables:
```
export TF_VAR_org_id="your_org_id"
export TF_VAR_folder_id="your_folder_id"
export TF_VAR_billing_account="your_billing_account_id"
```

With these settings in place, you can prepare a test project using Docker:
```
make docker_test_prepare
```

### Noninteractive Execution

Run `make docker_test_integration` to test all of the example modules
noninteractively, using the prepared test project.

### Interactive Execution

Review the [framework documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-foundation-toolkit/infra/blueprint-test#readme-4-test-execution) to learn how to execute tests.

## Linting and Formatting

Many of the files in the repository can be linted or formatted to
maintain a standard of quality.

### Execution

Run `make docker_test_lint`.
